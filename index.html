    <p> <font color="red">Dwight Kurt Schrute III (/Àà ÉruÀêt/; born January 20, 1968)[citation needed]
      is a character on The Office portrayed by Rainn Wilson. He is one of the highest-ranking salesmen
      as well as assistant to the regional manager (disputed)[1] at the paper distribution company Dunder
      Mifflin. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner,
      and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of
      social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office
      rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his romantic relationship with Angela.
      He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves
      as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. Dwight was also the Vice
      President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, but was soon replaced by Todd Packer,
       who was almost immediately terminated. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of
       permanent Regional Manager.</font></p>

        <h1>Casting</h1>
        Dwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor Rainn Wilson.
        In a Rolling Stone interview, Seth Rogen said he auditioned for the role.
         The character is based on Gareth Keenan of the original British version
         of the show, who was played by actor Mackenzie Crook.<br>
           All original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike Steve Carell,
            Wilson watched every episode of the original British series, and was a fan before he
            auditioned for the U.S. version.[2] Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael Scott,
            a performance he described as a "terrible Gervais impersonation";[2] however, the casting
            directors liked his audition as Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based
             Dwight's hairstyle on the style he himself had when at the age of sixteen.[2] In an interview,
             he said that he went to a barber to get "the worst haircut possible".[3]

<h2><em>What is Dwight up to now?</em></h2>
<p>When the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge,
  at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight formally held the
   title of <i><strong>"Assistant to the Regional Manager"</strong></i>,[4] but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant
    Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager,
    Michael Scott. (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in <i>"The Fight"</i>, tells him that
     no record/mention will be kept of the "title change only", then never acknowledges it again.)
     Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone
      else will give him.[2] </p>
